Miso Black Cod

Ingredients-

1. Black Cod - 4 fillets each (roughly 4-6 oz)
2. White Miso Paste - 1/2 cup
3. Sake - 1/2 cup
4. Mirin - 1/3 cup
5. Sugar - 5 tablespoons

Instructions-

Making the Marinade:

1.) Combine sake and mirin in a saucepan and bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Boil for 20 - 30 seconds to cook off alcohol.

2.) Reduce heat to medium-low and whisk in white miso and sugar and continue to whisk until marinade is smooth and glossy.

3.) Let marinade cool completely.

Preparing the Fish:

1.) Pat fillets dry and place in container or bags.

2.) Coat them completely with cooled marinade

3.) Refrigerate for 1-3 days. (The longer the better, I know 3 days is a while but definetely do at least 1 day.)

Cooking the Fish(Broiler):

1.) Place rack 6-8 inches below broiler and turn on.

2.) Remove fish from container or bag and very gently wipe off excess marinade to leave a thin film. DO NOT RINSE THE FISH

3.) Lightly salt and place on wire rack on a baking sheet.

4.) Broil fish for 8-10 minutes until the top is deep golden, caramelized, lightly charred.

Cooking the Fish(Sear and Bake):

1.) Pre-Heat oven to 400 F

2.) Put a skillet or pan with a high smoke point oil(Like avocado) on medium high heat

3.) Once pan is hot sear both sides of each fillet for 2-3 minutes a side. (Starting with skin-side up) Make sure to be very gentle with fish and to keep a close eye as to not burn any marinade

4.) Transfer all fish to a wire rack on a baking sheet and put in over for 5-7 minutes until just cooked through.

Things to note -

1.) All ovens/broilers are different and it is necessary to keep a close eye on the cooking process in the oven/broiler to prevent any burning or overcooking.

2.) Best served with steamed white rice and asparagus or baby bok choy.
