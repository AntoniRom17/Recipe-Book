Miso Black Cod

Ingredients-

1. Black Cod - 4 fillets each (roughly 4-6 oz)
2. White Miso Paste - 1/2 cup
3. Sake - 1/2 cup
4. Mirin - 1/3 cup
5. Sugar - 5 tablespoons

Instructions-

Making the Marinade:

1.) Combine sake and mirin in a saucepan and bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Boil for 20 - 30 seconds to cook off alcohol.

2.) Reduce heat to medium-low and whisk in white miso and sugar and continue to whisk until marinade is smooth and glossy.

3.) Let marinade cool completely.

Preparing the Fish:

1.) Pat fillets dry and place in container or bags.

2.) Coat them completely with cooled marinade

3.) Refrigerate for 1-3 days. (The longer the better, I know 3 days is a while but definetely do at least 1 day.)

Cooking the Fish(Broiler):

1.) Place rack 6-8 inches below broiler and turn on.

2.) Remove fish from container or bag and very gently wipe off excess marinade to leave a thin film. DO NOT RINSE THE FISH

3.) Lightly salt and place on wire rack on a baking sheet.

4.) Broil fish for 8-10 minutes until the top is deep golden, caramelized, lightly charred.

Cooking the Fish(Sear and Bake):

1.) Pre-Heat oven to 400 F

2.) Put a skillet or pan with a high smoke point oil(Like avocado) on medium high heat

3.) Once pan is hot sear both sides of each fillet for 2-3 minutes a side. (Starting with skin-side up) Make sure to be very gentle with fish and to keep a close eye as to not burn any marinade

4.) Transfer all fish to a wire rack on a baking sheet and put in over for 5-7 minutes until just cooked through.

Things to note -

1.) All ovens/broilers are different and it is necessary to keep a close eye on the cooking process in the oven/broiler to prevent any burning or overcooking.

2.) Best served with steamed white rice and asparagus or baby bok choy.

Hot Honey Sauce/Seasoning

4. 2 tsp Cayenne Pepper
5. 2 tsp Salt

7. 2 tsp Garlic Powder
8. 2 tsp Chipotle Powder
9. 2 tsp Smoked Paprika
10. 2 tsp MSG (Optional)

Instructions-

Sauce Preparation:

1.) Warm honey in a sauce pan on low heat until honey is loose and thinner. (Keep heat low to prevent any carmelization or burning)
2.) Stir in hot sauce and all spices.
3.) Keep on low heat 7-10 minutes and stir occasionally and lightly.
4.) Take off the heat and let sit for 15-20 minutes.
5.) Strain liquid if you want it more mild but leave as is if okay with a spicier flavor.
6.) Ready to use hot honey sauce!

For Seasoning Powder:

1.) Preheat oven to 170 F.
2.) After sauce cooled completely, spread thinly across 2-3 baking sheets.
3.) Bake at 170 F for 5 hours with oven cracked open slightly for the last 3 hours. Rotating pans every 30 minutes.
4.) Take out of oven and let cool completely.
5.) Grind down into desired consistency.

Things to Note-
1.) Your goal in the oven is to evaporate all water and moisture without actually cooking the product.
2.) The oven being cracked to allow moisture to escape is essential to dehydrating it.
3.) When warming the honey, if it begins to bubble take it off the burner immediately and lower you heat, it needs to come up to heat very slowly.
